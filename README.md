# Recipe Project
Build a recipe website to display HTML capability.
## About
This will be my first project with Odin, with the end goal being to practice basic HTML skills. This includes being able to construct the basic skeleton of an HTML page, use the terminal to create and navigate directories and files, and make use of the appropriate elements and tags.
