    <h1>Detroit Style Pizza</h1>

    <img src="../images/detroitpizza.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pillowy soft dough surrounds a core of browned cheese and warm sauce. Italy may be known for its culinary
        creations, but it can't be said that Detroit hasn't got its own piece of the pie to claim with this
        mouthwatering treat. Easy to prepare and an outstanding result without a wood-fire oven, you'll be sure to enjoy
        this recipe with your family and loved ones.</p>

        <li>340g high-quality natural casing pepperoni</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>

        <li><b>To Make the Dough in a Stand Mixer:</b> Combine flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer
            fitted with a dough hook attachment. Stir to combine, then add water. Mix on low speed until dough comes together into a
            rough ball, then shut off mixer and let rest for 10 minutes. Continue mixing at medium-low speed until dough forms
            a smooth, silky ball, about 10 minutes longer. (It should stick to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads rather
            than riding around the edges.) Remove dough hook, form dough into a tight ball, set in the bottom of the mixer
            bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume,
            about 2 hours.</li>
        <li><b>To Make the Dough in a Food Processor:</b> Combine flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a food processor
            and pulse to combine. Add water, then turn on processor and process until dough forms a ball that rides around
            the bowl of the processor, about 30 seconds. Continue processing for 30 seconds longer. Transfer dough to a bowl,
            form a tight ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled
            in volume, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li><b>To Make the Dough by Hand:</b> Combine flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk to combine, then add
            water and stir with a wooden spoon until a rough ball of dough has formed. Set aside for 10 minutes. Turn dough
            out onto a countertop and knead until a smooth, silky ball has formed, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to a bowl, form
            a tight ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in
            volume, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Pour a couple tablespoons olive oil in the bottom of a Detroit-style anodized aluminum pan or two 8- by 8-inch cake pans. (Split dough in half if using cake pans.) Transfer dough to pan(s) and turn to coat in oil. Press down
            on dough and spread it toward the edges. You won't be able to get it all the way to the edges; this is okay. Spread it as much as you can without tearing, then cover tightly in plastic and set aside for 30 minutes to allow
            dough to relax. Return to dough and stretch it out again. It should be able to reach the edges this time. If not, let
            it rest a little more and try again. To get the dough to stay in the corners, stretch it up beyond the corners so
            that it pulls back into place. Once dough is stretched, cover again and set aside while you make the sauce.</li>
        <li><b>For the Sauce:</b> Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 550°F (290°C), or as close to
            it as your oven gets. Heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering.
            Add minced garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add
            tomatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, and sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced to about 3 cups, about 30 minutes.
            Season to taste with salt.</li>
        <li><b>To Form the Pizza:</b> Press down on dough with your fingertips to remove any large air bubbles. Lay half
            of pepperoni (if using) evenly over face of dough. Top with cheese, spreading it evenly all the way to the very
            edges of the pan, then add remaining pepperoni. Spoon sauce over surface in 3 even rows. (You will need only about
            half the sauce—save the rest for another pizza.)</li>
        <li>Transfer to oven and bake until edges are black and bubbly and exposed cheese on top is starting to lightly
            brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a trivet or folded kitchen towel on countertop.</li>
        <li>Run a thin metal spatula all the way around the edges of the pan to loosen the pizza. Carefully lift it out
            and slide it onto a cutting board. Cut pizza and serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Special Equipment</h3>

    <p>Stand mixer or food processor (optional), Detroit-style 10- by 14-inch anodized aluminum pan (see note)</p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <p>Brick cheese is a high-fat aged cheese from Wisconsin. It has a buttery flavor and browns very well, giving
        Detroit pizza its distinct flavor. You can order it online from Amazon. If it's unavailable, you can use a
        combination of Jack or young cheddar and low-moisture mozzarella.

        For best results, use a Detroit-style anodized aluminum pan. If you can't get your hands on that kind of pan,
        you can split the recipe into two square 8- by 8-inch cake pans. </p>
